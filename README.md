# Hasura-Task-1

To run the project you need to have following installed -
1. Node
2. Express

To execute the app.js file - node app.js
This will run the server and then we can visit each route to see its function.

I have implemented the following routes:

1. http://localhost:8080/
2. http://localhost:8080/authors
3. http://localhost:8080/setcookies
4. http://localhost:8080/getcookies
5. http://localhost:8080/html
6. http://localhost:8080/robot.txt
7. http://localhost:8080/input
